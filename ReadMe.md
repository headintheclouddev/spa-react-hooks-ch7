# SPA - React Hooks - Chapter 7
## Summary
This is the Blogging Single Page Application (SPA) created to roughly mirror the output
of chapter 7 "Using Hooks for Routing" of the Learn React Hooks book by Daniel Bugl.

## Lessons learned:
1. Always (as much as possible) use UIF components rather than standard HTML elements.
2. Even though there are simpler options, life will be easier if you give in and do things in the UIF Redux way.
   In other words, your app is more likely to work and you'll have fewer headaches if you take the time to use Redux.
